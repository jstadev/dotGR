## Subquery in their own words

SubQuery is a leading data indexer that gives you fast, reliable, decentralised, and customised APIs for your web3 projects. They empower developers from over 80+ ecosystems (including Polkadot, Kusama, and all substrate-based chains) with rich indexed data to allow them to build intuitive and immersive experiences for their users. The SubQuery Network powers unstoppable apps with a resilient and decentralised infrastructure network. Use their blockchain developer toolkit to build the web3 applications of the future, without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics or multi-chain block scanners.

Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture. To find out more, visit our [documentation](https://academy.subquery).

### Getting started

SubQuery publishes a quick start guide for various Polkadot netoworks. For Polkadot, the example indexes all asset transfers using the balances pallet on the Polkadot Network.

You can follow along this [step by step guide](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart_chains/polkadot.html).

### Running and Hosting your Polkadot SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

- Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing), [view the instructions on how to run SubQuery Locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html)
- By publishing it to SubQuery's enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network), where we'll host your SubQuery project in production ready services for mission critical data with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. There even is a generous free tier. [Find out how](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html)
- [Coming Soon] By publishing it to the decentralised [SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and supports Polkadot from launch
